- What project does: 
    calculations for wireline engineers like following: 
      cable weak point calculator
      sinker bar weight calculator
      cable stretch calculator

- Project functionality:
  
  DONE: Cable weak point calculator:
    engineer chooses from list of cables and cable specs are getting populated
    engineer enters depth and toolstring weight in order to determine the maximum number
      of wires for rehead and pullout at this depth

  Max Pull calculator
    additionally percentage of pullout at certain depth: engineer enters the depth and percentage,
      software calculates the pull in lbs
  
  DONE: Sinker bar weight calculator:
    engineer enters the cable diameter, wellhead pressure and percentage for overbalance,
      software calculates the required weight of toolstring
    additionally the lubricator length functionality could be a plus:
      engineer enters the logging tool length, OD of weight bars and type (tungsten, lead, regular), 
      lubricator spacing - software calculates total lubricator length required
  
  Cable stretch calculator:
    engineer chooses cable type, enters current depth, environment (oil, gas, water), current tension - 
      software calculates current wireline stretch
  
  Z-chart (additional):
    engineer presses the 'add' button - software adds a line to the flange of the drum with input 
      element, engineer adds the depth.
    ability to store data in session storage in case engineer refreshes the page 
    ability to create .pdf and email (e.g. to engineer's email address)

  Cable keyseat calculator (additional)

  Cement Bond Log Predicted Pipe Time calculation:
    engineer enters the tool OD, casing ID, fluid type, tx-rx spacing (3 or 5 ft). 
    program caculates PPT in usec/ft or usec/m

  Form to submit bugs

- Technologies to use:

  React: rendering
  React-router: routing
  Redux-toolkit: state management
  JS Classes: calculations
  TypeScript: types assistance for calculations
  SASS: styling


Ideas:

- DONE: Add data validation to InputData.tsx:
  range prop with 2-item array should be provided with min and max
  if min or max are exceeded, then small red text under the input
  element will pop up saying 'VALUE MAY BE OUTSIDE OF NORMAL OPERTING RANGE'

- DONE: In Weight Bar: add database of most of the weight bars and weights. And offer
  which sinker bars to use for engineer, based on diameter of tools

- DONE: Add 'Choose Units' page where engineer chooses depth, pressure etc. units. then
  to use all these units for calculations. Special conversion function needs to be
  created

- those items that are not shared between components -> move to useState
  like changeDepth to useState

- Add number of holes in cone for rehead for each cable type for calculations of max rehead

- Add casing database

- Add tubing database
